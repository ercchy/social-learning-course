Community Design 101: Build a Course the P2PU Way (Still a WIP)

---

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p2pu/social-learning-course.png)](https://travis-ci.org/p2pu/social-learning-course)

In Learning Design 101 you’ll produce a course that works like the web--networked, open, community-driven and sustainable. You’ll develop your course using the methodologies we use at P2PU to build learning communities on the web. From “jump” you’ll be in the thick of:
- How learning communities work and design principles
- Pedagogies that prize interaction and feedback
- Nurturing creative serendipity in small groups
- Selecting the right open platform for your course
- Building an audience by building with your audience
- Defining success and iterating on your course design

This project is based on https://github.com/p2pu/jekyll-course-template

##Why Community?

**At P2PU, we learn together.** What does that mean? It means that learning always has a “social context” or people who support each other, urge each other to stretch, suggest ideas or help solve problems. So the “P2PU way” of learning means that we must first find a group of like-minded folks, a crew or a tiger team. 

We believe that designing a community is key to a good learning experience. While there are other modes of learning, and some folks like to learn alone, loads of research, experience and common sense tell us that *social engagement* sustains a learning path. In this part of the course, we’ll talk about different kinds of communities, and how to build one around your learning goals. 

##What’s Community?

Community is a sense of *shared purpose and belonging*. Think about your local PTA, block party association, church, book club or 


As a facilitator, you are designing a learning community. In your course, how 

- How to ask people to participate in the course
- How to welcome people to the community
- Celebrate successes
- 

Community is a continuum

# Projects 

We’re all part of some kind of community, both face-to-face and online. Communities vary in size, purpose, activity and level of participation, but it’s likely that you’re involved in at least one. 

## Project 3: What communities are you a part of?
Think of 3 communities that you are a part of. How big are they? How do they interact? What is their shared purpose? What value do you receive from them? How much time do you invest in them?

## Project 4: Observe a community. 
Think about a community that you belong to online. Is it a Community of Interest, Practice, or Inquiry? Why? 
Also:

- What kinds of jargon do they use? 
- How do they welcome new members to the community? 
- What feedback mechanisms do they have? 
- How do they decide what is good what isn’t?
- Which mechanisms would you pick up and choose for your course?

## Project 5: Find your crew.
Expanding your course design team is the first step in building your learning community. In asking folks to participate, you are distributing ownership of the course and expanding your learning network. 

- Who would want to co-develop this course with you? 
- Who are other experts in the field who would want to contribute ideas and resources? 
- Reach out to 3-4 folks, show them your hackpad and ask for feedback and additional ideas.

Put your answers in your Hackpad and post both the link and the answers to the Discourse forum.

## Why Social Learning?
>We found that learners studied over 2x as many questions when they were in a group study session as when they were alone. This was important because we wanted to make sure that studying with others wasn’t just making people slower to answer questions. But learners study more than twice as many questions, on average, when in group study than when they study alone.

>Peer learning also helps us learn others things: engaging with others, communicating our ideas, and trying to understand theirs, negotiating different interests and perspectives, and collaborating on joint projects. These are the types of non-cognitive skills that may be more important for finding a job and living successful lives. And, as the global population rises to somewhere around 10 billion people, squeezed together on a pretty small planet, getting along with each other, and working together will not be an option, but a necessity.

## Focus on Your First 10
>People jumping straight into coworking calculating square footage & sizing up furniture, or obsessing over branding and their website, are skipping over the important and crucial step to developing a healthy community: *finding your first 10 coworkers*. Everything else can come after that.

>Where you find them will vary. What they’ll look like will vary. But these first 10 people are the human seeds of your coworking space to be. They will be the #1 reason that other people want to come work with you at your coworking space.

## What Social Learning Can Do

>A networked learner can start a company with 3 people she’s never met face-to-face--but knows because they met in an open online course.
